# SaturnVOrbit

This is a project I completed as a semester project for a 
university computer graphics course.

The project uses three.js with imported models created with Blender
to shape a 3D scene of the Saturn V rocket orbiting around the moon.

Any user wishing to run the program might have to run it through a
php localhost server.
