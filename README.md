# SaturnVOrbit

This is a project I completed as a semester project for a 
university computer graphics course.  It is a 3D scene of the 
Saturn V rocket in orbit around the moon that implements
the Three.js graphics library to create the scene
using imported models in a web browser.  A user has the ability
to orbit around the scene using a mouse to change the view.

An mp4 demo of the web application can be found at

for download.
